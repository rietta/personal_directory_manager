Personal Directory Manager

The Personal Directory Manager started out as a project by Frank Rietta in 1996.  His 
goals were to create a contact manager that would be useful.  It started out as a basic 
program and evolved over the years to include many useful features.  The source code for 
PDM has now been released since it is no longer being actively developed.  

You are free to make any changes or additions to the source code you would like as long 
as you make the modified source code available free of charge.  You may compile the 
source code and distribute the application produced from the code as long as it is 
available free of charge over the internet and contains a statement that it was based of 
Personal Directory Manager code with a link to http://www.rietta.com/pdm/.
